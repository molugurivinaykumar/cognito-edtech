### Narrative of Key Steps:
The project started with planning and research to understand the client's requirements and preferences. A wireframe was created for the website's structure and layout. The HTML and CSS were used to build the website's structure and styling, respectively. The homepage includes a header and footer section, a banner slider, and featured courses. The course listing page displays all available courses with their images, titles, instructors, and prices.

The course detail page includes a larger course image, a detailed description, and an option to enroll in the course. The enrollment functionality is implemented using JavaScript and allows students to add courses to their cart, view the course summary, and process the payment through a secure payment gateway.

The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Best practices were followed throughout the development process, including the use of semantic HTML, proper code commenting, and testing for cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. Finally, the website was deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible to the public.
